lost and found app for university students

The goal of this app is to make it easier for college students to retrieve lost items. Users can report items they find as well as where they put them. Users can also report items they have lost. Anyone can view the lost and found list. This means that users can find their lost items on the list, and other users can stay on the lookout for items flagged as lost. 

University lost and found systems do not work very well as lost items can be left at a multitude of university locations. Also, items with no attributed name may never be recovered.

We rely on good faith for item recovery.
